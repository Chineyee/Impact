   - Project is assigned unique ID and marked as active

2. Donation Process
   - One-time donations: Direct contribution with immediate NFT minting

   - Each successful donation mints a unique Impact NFT to donor's address

3. Fund Management
   - Transparent tracking of project progress
   - Automatic fund accumulation
   - Secure withdrawal mechanism upon target completion
